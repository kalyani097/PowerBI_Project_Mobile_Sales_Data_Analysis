Power BI Dashboard on Mobile Sales Analysis. Introducing my latest Project: The Mobile Sales Analysis Project.

## üéØProject Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that provides detailed insights into mobile sales data. The dashboard aims to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total quantity sold, transaction counts, and average prices. Additionally, it seeks to analyze sales trends by various dimensions including mobile models, brands, payment methods, cities, and time periods (monthly, quarterly, and yearly). The goal is to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing sales performance and identifying areas for improvement.

## üìäProject Overview
